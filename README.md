# Robust Neural Network Model for ODEs and FDEs

This thesis research develops an advanced neural network model poised to set a new standard in the approximation of classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and Fractional Differential Equations (FDEs). The model, underpinned by the Caputo method for handling fractional derivatives, is specifically engineered to achieve industry-level accuracy.

## Mathematical Framework
Central to the research is an in-depth exploration of fractional calculus, focusing on the Caputo derivative's application, renowned for its ability to handle non-local dependencies characteristic of FDEs. The neural network is intricately trained using a loss function that embodies both the equation's residuals and the physical constraints inherent to the system, thus enforcing a strong adherence to the physical laws governing the differential equations.

## Model Features
- **Caputo Derivative Integration**: Direct implementation of the Caputo method ensures accurate representation of fractional dynamics.
- **Physical Informativeness**: The model's loss function incorporates the residuals of differential equations, grounding predictions in physical reality.
- **High Precision Solutions**: Delivers solutions with precision that aligns with the rigors of industrial applications.

## Setup and Execution
To deploy this model:

1. Download the project repository to your environment.
2. Install dependencies as specified in `requirements.txt` via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Initiate the model training with `python train.py`, adjusting parameters as needed for your specific dataset.
4. Assess the model's accuracy using `python evaluate.py`, which provides comparative visualizations between the model's outputs and established solutions.

This research encapsulates a significant leap in computational methods for differential equations, bridging the gap between theoretical mathematics and practical, real-world application through the use of neural networks.
